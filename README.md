# typingSpeedTester

A simple python script that reacts to keystrokes to measure typing speed without having to copy text correctly.

A word is simply defined as any time you hit either space, tab or enter. So yes, if you spam space, you can get a really fast speed but whatâ€™s the point of that.

It also measures error rate as the percentage of your keystrokes that were a backspace.

It will also stop timing after 5 seconds of no keystrokes. This timeout is configurable in the code.

Also, I guarantee there is not actual recording of keystrokes only of the number of keystrokes.
